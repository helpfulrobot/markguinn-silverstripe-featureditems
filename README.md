Silverstripe Featured Items Module
==============

Very simple way to add a slideshow or other set of featured images/links to a page. Includes easy markup for Foundation's Orbit component.


Requirements
------------
- Silverstripe 3.1+ (may work with 3.0, but hasn't been tested)
- Compatible with but does not require Zurb Foundation


Features
--------
- Add HasFeaturedItems extension to any page type
- A featured item contains an image and links to:
	- an external url
	- an internal page
	- a video (youtube or vimeo)
- LinksToVideo extension can be used on any dataobject to make linking to and embedding videos really easy - just
  enter the url and it parses out the video ID and gives you the correct embed code.
- Include FeaturedItems template to get instant markup for use with Zurb Foundation's Orbit and Reveal components
- Could easily be adapted to work with any slideshow component.


Usage
-----
You need to add the “HasFeaturedItems” extension to any page type that should have them. You can do this via yaml config like so (this would go in a .yml file in mysite/_config):

```
Page:
  extensions:
    - HasFeaturedItems
```

(replace Page with HomePage or XYZPage or whatever if you don’t want it on all types of pages)

Then in the page template just add:

```
<% include FeaturedItems %>
```

If you’re using Zurb Foundation you’re good to go. If not you may need to change up the markup in that FeaturedItems template.
